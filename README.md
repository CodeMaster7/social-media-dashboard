  width: $size;
  height: $size;

  @if $radius != 0 {
    border-radius: $radius;
  }
}

.avatar {
  @include square(100px, $radius: 4px);
}
```

```css

}
```

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me for CSS flexbox. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Grid. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
